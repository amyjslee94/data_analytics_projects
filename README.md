Welcome to the Data Analytics Projects repository! This repository contains data-driven projects focused on predictive modeling, dashboard creation, and analytics using real-world datasets.

## Projects

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction (~ 80% Complete)

**Objective**: Fit a predictive model to determine passenger survival likelihood based on various features.

- **Dataset**: Titanic dataset

- **Approach**: Utilize logistic regression and other machine learning techniques to build a classification model.

- **Outcome**: A model capable of predicting survival probability with reasonable accuracy.

### 2. Music Streaming Analysis & Prediction (Just Getting Started)

**Objective**: Utilize MusicBrainz and streaming platform data (Spotify, YouTube) to analyze music performance and predict future hits.

- **Data Sources**

  - **MusicBrainz & Spotify API**: For retrieving metadata on new songs.
  
  - **YouTube**: To gather streaming performance metrics.

- **Approach**

  - Extract metadata and streaming statistics.

  - Create interactive dashboards to visualize trends.

  - Build predictive models to forecast whether a song will be in the top 100 YouTube charts in various regions for the upcoming week.

- **Outcome**: A data pipeline and predictive analytics model to assess potential viral songs.
